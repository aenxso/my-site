                Once upon a time, one of my dearest friends graduated university and set off into the world of being a <em>real</em> software developer. Somewhere along the way he wrote a piece which was featured by his company, focusing around something called ‚ÄúImposter Syndrome‚Äù. Little me didn‚Äôt know what the heck that was but I congratulated him nonetheless for being featured. When I did look into the meaning, I was so confused‚Ä¶ <em>why would someone so smart who has a whole computer science degree feel like they can‚Äôt code or work well?</em>
                Fast forward a few years and it‚Äôs my turn to graduate university! Never failed a course, completed a co-op, had fun in the challenging courses, I should be brimming with confidence and ready to get a real job. .. right? <br><br>

                Absolutely not. <br><br>

                I have never in my life felt like a bigger fraud than I did when I graduated university. SFU must have mixed my name up with someone else‚Äôs because why on earth did they give me a CS degree. Did I complete all the requirements? Yes. Did I do all my homework? Yes. Did I finish all my exams? Yes. Does that mean I deserve a degree at the end? No. Why not? Because I‚Äôm not sure if I even know what a for loop is??? (jks yes I do) <br><br>

                After graduating I put myself on a hamster wheel of taking more online courses, learning new languages, learning new areas of development, doing side projects, doing leetcode everyday because God forbid I don‚Äôt answer a technical interview question correctly on the first try. Basically chasing perfection, and while I don‚Äôt think anything is impossible, I‚Äôm not sure that exists in software engineering. At the end of my co-op, the final bit of feedback my team leader had for me was that I did things too perfectly. At the time I took that as a compliment and thought I performed flawlessly but now I can see‚Ä¶ perfectionism really is a disease of the mind. <br> <br>
                And it‚Äôs all just in my head. <br><br>
                One day I have to dive into the deep end. <br><br>
                And for once, I‚Äôm ready to be my own friend and help myself swim along the way.<br><br>

                Okay and yes, maybe making this diary entry into a website is still a bit of that ego wanting to prove that I know how to make a website. But through it I learned that web dev is pretty cool. Everything I learned post-uni was cooler than I thought it would be. So while someone out there may be like ‚ÄônOw YoU gOt A tImE gAp On YoUr ReSuMe‚Äô, <a id="actually" href="#">actually,<img src="./src/assets/ackchyually.gif"/></a> I learned how fun and expansive coding can be. And I learned how to be my own friend, which I would definitely trade in my fraud degree for 100 times over. <br><br>

                To be honest, if this panoramic (read pandemic) hadn‚Äôt happened, none of that ^ would‚Äôve happened either. But I‚Äôm glad it did. <br><br>

                Also‚Ä¶ honesty is nice. If anyone is reading this and made it to the bottom, hi üëãüèΩ I hope someone gives you a cinnamon roll out of kindness this week ‚ò∫Ô∏è <br><br>
